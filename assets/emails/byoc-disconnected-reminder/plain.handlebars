Hello {{username}}, 

This is a gentle reminder that your BYOC cluster {{regionName}} added to your {{workspaceName}} is not accessible from Patr due to unknown reasons.

Verify whether the cluster is in active state from your cloud provider's dashboard.

If {{regionName}} cluster is already deleted in the cloud provider, then mark this cluster as deleted from the Patr dashboard.

If the cluster is not accessible in {{deadlineLimit}} days, then {{regionName}} cluster and the deployments made in that cluster will be marked as deleted in Patr.

If you are facing any issues, reach out to us at support@patr.cloud
