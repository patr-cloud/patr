Hello {{username}}, 

This is a gentle reminder that your BYOC cluster {{regionName}} added to your {{workspaceName}} is not accessible from Patr due to unknown reasons. 

Verify whether the cluster is in an active state from your cloud provider's dashboard. 

If {{regionName}} cluster has already been deleted in the cloud provider, then mark it as deleted from the Patr dashboard as well. 

If the cluster is not accessible in {{deadlineLimit}} days, then {{regionName}} cluster and the deployments made in that cluster will be deleted in Patr. 

If you are facing any issues, reach out to us at support@patr.cloud
