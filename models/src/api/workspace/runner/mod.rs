/// run. Since runners are long-lived processes, they can be disconnected and
/// reconnected at any time. This struct represents the state of a runner. Since
/// runners are arbitrary code that executes the deployments, they can execute
/// the deployments in any way they want. This includes running the deployments
/// on a VM, kubernetes, or even on other PaaS providers.
